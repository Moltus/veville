# website for fictional car rental company "VÃ©ville"

Goal was to make a functional front/backend ordering website with accounts / orders / car & agencies data and a backoffice section for admin use.
Fully developped around PHP and SQL for databases, it has some ajax queries for refreshing data and uses a very basic Bootstrap interface.
